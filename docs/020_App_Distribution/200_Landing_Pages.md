### Managing Landing pages

Landing pages are the most common way to distribute apps to your testers.
Every app in testfairy, by default, has a landing page that is automatically generated once you upload an app to testfairy via the various app loading ways.

If you do not want a landing page you can disable it on the landing page settings page for that specific app:

The Settings of a landing page are defined in the Landing Page Settings page inside your app page in the app dashboard: 


![landing page settings](/img/landing-page-fields.png)


* **Landing page URL:** the URL that is automatically generated for each landing page. It is possible to change the last part after the / - slash, to a different string if available.

* **App version:** indicates which version of the app will be downloaded from the landing page.

* **Permission:**  there are 3 ways to allow access to the app download: 
  * _Open Beta (Anyone can download)_ - download is possible to anybody who  can see the page.
  * _Closed Beta (Testers required to login)_ - you must have a TesfFairy account (as a tester or admin) in order to see the page (and download the app).
  * _Opt-In (Testers can ask you to join)_ - in this option the page is open but if testers want to download your app they need to ask permission using the ![sing me up](/img/sign-me-up-button.png)
Button. This will trigger a sign-up process details [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/Testers/Managing_Testers.html#managing-testers) .

* **App description:** A description you can add to the landing page to give your testers instructions or other information. Can be formatted in <a href=https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ target=_blank >Markdown</a>.

* **Add release notes:** do you want to include the release notes detailed when you loaded the app on the landing page?
* **Add custom CSS:**  see [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/FAQ/Landing_Page_Customization.html) for customizing the appearance of the landing page.


Once you make changes to the settings you need to save them for them to take effect. You can preview the changes using the **Preview landing page** button.
