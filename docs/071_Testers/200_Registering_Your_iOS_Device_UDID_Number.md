### Registering your device

In order to start testing with TestFairy, you need to be invited by an app developer.
Once you receive an invitation via email or landing page, download or register your device, if you are requested to do so.
This is a very quick and simple process, which you will only have to do once.
Some apps won't require you to register your device. In this case, simply click on the download link and follow the instructions on screen. 

### When asked to register your device

1. Open the invitation email and follow the link to //**register your mobile device in TestFairy**//.
2. Make sure you open the link with the **Safari** browser.
3. The link will open your tester dashboard at [my.testfairy.com](https://my.testfairy.com) and display the `Register device` button. Click it to initiate the download.
4. You will be prompted to download the TestFairy configuration profile. Click the **Allow** button to download it.
5. Once the profile was downloaded go to the **settings app** and click on the **profile downloaded** menu. 
6. The profile installer will open. Click on **Install**.
7. Your device is now registered in TestFairy. Please wait for the developer to send you a download link.



### Downloading apps

1. Click the “DOWNLOAD APP” link in the email.

2. Click the “Download App" button in your Safari browser.
