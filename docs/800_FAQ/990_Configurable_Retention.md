## Configurable Retention and default retention

TestFairy allows enterprise clients with sensitive data and strict security requirements, to configure their default 180 days retention policy. 

We allow to set anything from 14-30-60-90-180 days. 

By default we set the retention for 180 days for paid users. This applies to any build, artifact or session recording you uploaded to us. 

Please note that free users receive a retention period of 30 days! 

If your build has been deleted, but your application is still recording and reporting sessions, those wont be affected and will be still captured on our platform.

To configure your retention for enterprise cliens please [contact TestFairy Support](https://testfairy.com/contact)
