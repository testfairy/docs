## Configurable Retention and default retention

TestFairy allows enterprise clients with sensitive data and strict security requirements, to configure their default 180 days retention policy. 

We allow the retention to be set to anything from 14-30-60-90-180 days. 

By default, we set the retention for 180 days for paid users. This applies to any build, artifact, or session recording you uploaded to us. 

If your build has been deleted, but your application is still recording and reporting sessions, those won't be affected and still be captured on our platform.

To configure your retention for enterprise clients please [contact TestFairy Support](https://testfairy.com/contact)
